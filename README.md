# Portfolio Website Drupal Template 

This is an empty template for anybody who is interested in setting up a Drupal-based portpolio website. This template is desigend and developed by Myeong Lee, and feel free to modify it when you use it. This repository is under GNU license. 

## Pre-requisites
You need to have the following software installed on your PC:
- Vagrant 1.8.6
- VirtualBox 5.1.6
- Ansible 2.1.0 
- Python 2.x

If you're using a Windows machine, Ansible is not available -- you need to install required packages inside your Vagrant machine (once it's up). For the software packages required, see `vm/basic/playbook.yml`. 

Also, after you install everything, you need to know how to use Drupal to configure the website properly. 

## Local Environment Set-up

1. Clone this repo to your computer.
2. On your command line, run the following command to download and configure a Vagrant machine (Ubuntu Xenial running on VirtualBox):
```
cd vm/basic/
vagrant up
```
This will take a while. Grab a cup of coffee...
If you face any issues while running the Vagrant scripts, it's mostly software version issues. If you cannot resolve it, contact Myeong. 

3. Once a Vagrant machine is up, it's ready to be used. You can access to the machine by typing:
``` 
vagrant ssh
```
When you're done using the machine, type `vagrant halt` to turn the machine off. The Ubuntu image is saved, but it's removed from your memory space. 
You can start developing the portfolio in `html`, and it will automatically applied to the Ubuntu machine. 

4. Migrate `DB/myeong_portfolio.sql` to the MySQL DB running on the Vagrant machine. The default ID/Password is `root` and `root`. You can change it once you SSH into the machine (chaging credential is recommended for the security purpose). 

5. Copy `html/sites/default/themes/default.settings.php` to `html/sites/default/themes/settings.php`. Inside this file, modify the DB information (if applicable).

6. You can access your development website by going to `192.168.33.13` on your browser.

7. Enabling Clean URLs
	- Open `/etc/apache2/apache2.conf`, go to the line where `<Directory "/var/www/">` is at, and modify the line `AllowOverride None` to `AllowOverride All`. 	
	- Then clean URL works for Drupal sites. 

8. Once development is done, you can deploy `html` folder to your own server (you can make use of the Ansible scripts to configure your server automatically).
